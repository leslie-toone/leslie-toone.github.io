<p>I am a data analyst with a passion for machine learning.   I've been a stay-at-home mom for many (13!) years but before being a mom, I 
earned a BS and MS in Statistics from Utah State University. I worked professionally for 5 years in data analysis and taught Introduction 
to Statistics at Utah State for 4 years. I have run many queries and data analyses on large, complex data sets using several different programs, 
including Python, SQL and Tableau. I worked at Novell and helped them turn their raw data into actionable information that helped them better understand 
their customers, improve their pricing and program strategies, and review their business strategies.  I used machine learning algorithms when 
I worked for a dementia study at Utah State University that automated and improved classification of individuals according to dementia status. 
I know a lot has developed in artificial intelligence and data analysis since I stopped working, and over the last couple of years I have been 
studying (via Kaggle, Coursera, and other online resources) artificial intelligence and improving my Python programming skills.<br>
I have loved the many available resources that have helped me refresh and improve my data science skills. </p>
